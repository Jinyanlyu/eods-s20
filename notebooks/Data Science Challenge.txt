Data Science Challenge
============================

Welcome to your challenge project!

For this challenge, we ask that you implement a solution at home in your own time. When you're ready, please send us your code and results. We estimate that the challenge should take somewhere between 1 and 5 hours depending on your experience and speed.


Motivation
----------

Your challenge is to gain an understanding of a small loan-application dataset so that we can double-check the work of agents making quick-fire loan determinations by text.


Goals
-----

1. Data Understanding

    · Convert the data-set into whatever format makes the most sense to you.
    · Please keep track of any statistics or findings that you think are relevant to solving the problem.
    · Please provide a thorough analysis of the relationships between the target and the various features and also the relationships between the important features.

2. Prediction / Classification

    · Based on your understanding, build a quick classifier to determine what the result should be for a new customer
    · Explain your results and the reason(s) you believe your model is valid

Please provide your source code and a document outlining your findings and explanations, along with the data if you significantly transformed it.
